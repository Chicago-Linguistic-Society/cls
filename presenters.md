# Main Session Presenters
Please plan to speak for 20 minutes, with 10 minutes for questions. Plan to bring your own laptop for connection to the projector system; if this is not possible or in case of technical difficulties, we can provide a laptop during your session for this purpose, but please email all presentation materials in advance if this is the case.
