## Format: 

- The conference will consist of 16 sessions total - 12 sessions of 3-4 20-minute stage presentations each, and 4 sessions of 3-4 5-minute poster presentations each. 
- 20-minute presentations will have 10-minute Q & A periods following them (for a total of 30 minutes per presenter), while 5-minute presentations will have 5-minute Q & A periods following them (for a total of 10 minutes per presenter).  
- After all of the 5-minute presentations in a poster session are given, the rest of the session will be reserved for a 50-minute poster mingle. During this time, each poster will get its own breakout room, where presenters and attendees can engage in longer conversations about the work that was presented. 
- There will also be 6 plenaries - these will be one hour long each, consisting of 40-minute presentations followed by 20-minute Q & A periods. 
- All sessions will be synchronous and occur on Zoom. Presenters, as well as those who register ([here](https://forms.gle/6onoAVAd5UjgA91A8)), will receive passwords to access the Zoom calls. The conference will also be streamed to YouTube on an unlisted channel. Recordings of the conference will be available for 1 week before being deleted. 
- All sessions will be ASL interpreted and captioned. 
- Finally, we will also be using Discord to facilitate more casual 'hallway conversations'. The Discord server (link to come) will feature a text-based chatroom dedicated to each presentation, where presenters and attendees can talk further (and asynchronously). The Discord will also include purely social chatrooms.
