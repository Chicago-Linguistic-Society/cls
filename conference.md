CLS is pleased to announce the plenary speakers for the 58th Annual Conference.

Lal Zimman is a Professor of Sociolinguistics and Linguistic Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His research focuses on ethnographic, discourse analytic, and sociophonetic methods of examining the relationship of language to identity and gender, particularly for LGBTQ speakers.

Kathryn Davidson is an Associate Professor of Linguistics at Harvard University, where her research addresses questions in semantics and pragmatics using experimental methods and fieldwork. Her work in these areas draws especially on insights from the variety of modalities of human language (signed, spoken, etc.) and from language acquisition and its relation to cognitive development.

James Kirby is a Professor in the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences of University of Edinburgh. His research interests are sound change, computational and statistical methods in phonetics, tone and register, language and music, and languages of Southeast Asia. His latest research includes Incorporating tone in the calculation of phonotactic probability, Individuals, communities, and sound change: an introduction, and Relating production and perception of L2 tone.

Monica Do is a Provostâ€™s Postdoctoral Fellow in Linguistics at the University of Chicago. Her research on language production focuses on how we decide what it is we want to talk about and how we turn our conceptual representations of the world into a linguistic form that is suitable for the language we speak. To do this, her work brings together topics in event cognition, pragmatics, and theoretical linguistics. Dr. Do studies these processes in language production using visual world eye-tracking and other behavioral techniques in different languages.

Roger Levy is a Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His research focuses on theoretical and applied questions in the processing and acquisition of natural language. Dr. Levy answers these questions by combining computational modeling, psycholinguistic experimentation, and analysis of large naturalistic language datasets.

Emily Gasser is a Professor of Linguistics at Swarthmore College. Her research is in Austronesian and Australian languages, Wallacea & northwest New Guinea, language documentation and fieldwork, generative phonology, language contact and change, language endangerment, computational phylogenetics, Wamesa, and intonational socio-phonetics.
