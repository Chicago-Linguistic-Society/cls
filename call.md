## We aren't accepting abstracts just yet, but stay tuned for our CFP in the fall! 

<!-- The Chicago Linguistic Society invites abstracts in any area of current research on the human language faculty, to include but not limited to syntax, morphology, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, phonology, phonetics, and all relevant interfaces and allied fields in cognitive/social sciences. We particularly encourage submissions relevant to this year’s proposed special sessions, detailed below.

Presenters will be given 20 minutes for presentation followed by a 10-minute question period. Presented papers will be published in the CLS proceedings. This year’s conference features a poster session; those presenting a poster may be chosen as alternates for talks, and poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the proceedings. -->


<!-- ## Special Topics: -->

<!-- #### <u>Languages of South Asia</u> -->



<!-- #### <u>Sign Linguistics</u> -->


<!-- #### <u>Language Documentation and Revitalization</u> -->


<!-- #### <u>Race and Language</u> -->

<!-- ## Abstract Guidelines 

So that we may evaluate all submissions in a fair and equal manner, abstracts which fail to adhere to any of the following guidelines will be automatically rejected. Abstracts will be evaluated under a two-tiered system involving both external and internal reviewers.

1. Submit your abstract(s) in PDF format with filename PaperTitle.pdf (e.g., Prosodic_Form_and_Discourse_Function.pdf).
2. Include paper title and keywords (i.e., CLS session title, linguistic subfield(s), language(s)/ language family) in the abstract.
3. Limit abstracts to two letter-sized or A4 pages in length, inclusive of data and references. Use one-inch margins and a font size no smaller than 11 point. Incorporate data into the main text of the abstract, not on a separate page.
4. Anonymize submissions by not including author name(s) in the abstract or filename. If necessary, remove author name(s) from the document properties of the PDF file.
5. Use the [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cls56) (to be updated) platform for the submission of abstracts.
6. Restrict submissions to one individual and one joint abstract per author, or two joint abstracts per author. -->
