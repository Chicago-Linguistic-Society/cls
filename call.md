<h3>Meeting Description:</h3>
  
The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. This academic year, CLS will host its 59th annual meeting, which will be held from Friday, April 28 to Sunday, April 30, 2023.

<h3>Call for Papers:</h3>

The Chicago Linguistic Society invites abstracts in any area of current research on the human language faculty, including but not limited to syntax, morphology, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, phonology, phonetics, and all relevant interfaces and allied fields in cognitive/social sciences. We particularly encourage submissions relevant to this year’s proposed special sessions, detailed below.

Presenters will be given 20 minutes for their presentation followed by a 10-minute question period. Presented papers will be published in the CLS proceedings. This year’s conference features a poster session; those presenting a poster may be chosen as alternates for talks. All talks and poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the proceedings.

<h3>Special Topics:</h3>

We particularly encourage submissions relevant to this year’s proposed special topics:

- Ancient languages
- Arctic languages
- Syntax-prosody interface

Details on each of the special topics can be found on EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cls59](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cls59)) and our website ([http://chicagolinguisticsociety.org/call.html](http://chicagolinguisticsociety.org/call.html))

<h3>Land Acknowledgement:</h3>

The Chicago Linguistic Society is headquartered at the University of Chicago, which was built on the occupied and unceded lands ancestrally stewarded by many Native peoples. These include the people of the Council of Three Fires (the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa nations) as well as the Menominee, Kickapoo, Miami, Sac and Fox, and Ho-Chunk nations. Today, Cook County is home to 39,000 Native people representing more than 100 tribal nations.

<h3>Questions?</h3>

Please email us at _chicagolinguisticsociety.cls59@gmail.com_ for any questions or issues that may arise.

<h3>Special Topics</h3>

**Ancient languages:**

While the study of ancient and liturgical languages has traditionally been associated with philological work and historical linguistics, we would like to showcase work from all theoretical linguistic disciplines and interdisciplinary work that deal with linguistic data and the methodology of working with ancient and liturgical languages without native speaker consultants.

**Arctic languages:**

Arctic languages are not defined by a particular latitude, but rather encompass the indigenous languages spoken in the northernmost region of the globe, an area historically understudied. Arctic language linguistics might involve formalist subfields, sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, linguistic anthropology, language revitalization, or any other area pertaining to language.

**Prosody-syntax interface:**

The interaction between prosody (rhythmic and metrical structure at levels higher than the word) and syntax (the form of sentences and words) has been a large focus of research in the formal (and experimental) linguistic community for many decades. We welcome any submissions relating to the interface between prosody and syntax in any language and from any methodological approach.
