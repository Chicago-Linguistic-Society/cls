Meeting Description:

The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. This academic year, CLS will host its 58th annual meeting, which will be held from Friday, April 22 to Sunday April 24, 2022.

Call for Papers:

The Chicago Linguistic Society invites abstracts in any area of current research on the human language faculty, to include but not limited to syntax, morphology, semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, phonology, phonetics, and all relevant interfaces and allied fields in cognitive/social sciences. Presented papers will be published in the CLS proceedings. This year’s conference features a poster session; those presenting a poster may be chosen as alternates for talks, and the poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the proceedings.

Sociophonetics
Sign Languages
Language and Music

COVID-19: While we are aiming for this conference to be held in-person in April 2022, we acknowledge the possibility of COVID disrupting this plan, and will also consider hosting CLS online if absolutely necessary. A final decision will be made closer to the starting date of the event, with attention paid to the evolving situation and to the preferences of the participants.
