title: Call for Papers
---

The Chicago Linguistic Society invites abstracts in any area of current research on the human language faculty, to include phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics, as well as allied fields in the cognitive and social sciences. We particularly encourage submissions relevant to this year's proposed special topics, detailed below.

Presenters will be given 20 minutes for presentation followed by a 10-minute question period. Presented papers will be published in the CLS proceedings.

## Special Topics:

#### Negation and Polarity

Negation is a universal property of natural language, and creates a complex area of study where morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and logic meet. Negative polarity, likewise, has enjoyed considerable attention in the past 30 years, with lots of important generalizations emerging from intense crosslinguistic work. We invite submissions addressing aspects of negation and polarity, including: (a) the nature and formal
characterization of polarity items, negative quantifiers, and n-words; (b) the status of expletive negation; and (c) the relation between explicit and implicit negations. Theoretical as
well as experimental approaches are welcome, as well as data from a variety of languages.

#### Language Endangerment: Causes and Interventions

The study of language endangerment lies at the intersection of numerous areas of research, including (but not limited to): language policy, language attitudes and ideology, and language shift. We welcome all
submissions that explore the root causes of endangerment, as well as those that attend to the
methodologies of documentation and revitalization. We are also interested in submissions
that evaluate how best to treat data from endangered languages in established theoretical
frameworks.

#### Language Change

Knowledge of how languages have changed over time can contribute
much to our understanding of synchronic systems. We therefore urge submissions grounded
in a diachronic perspective, which may include linguistic reconstruction, methods in modeling change, historical linguistics, linguistic typology, sociolinguistic approaches to change,
language variation, and language contact. Submissions that engage new methodologies of
reconstruction, or the reconstruction of understudied languages and families, are especially
encouraged.

#### Features and Metafeatures

Formal linguists from a variety of subfields have long endeav-
ored to decompose grammatical categories into atomic, context-free features. The features
that characterize categories such as person, number, and gender appear to exhibit `metafeatures': they may be binary or privative in their valence; marked or unmarked in their values;
dominant or dominated in their positions within hierarchies; recursive or nonrecursive in
their application. Certain categories appear to resist degradation into abstract primitives,
to include noun classes, social deixis, and perhaps case. We wish to attract submissions
that examine: (a) the architecture of morphosyntactic (meta)features (e.g., filters, geometries, valencies); (b) the limits of featural reductionism; (c) the syntactic, semantic, and/or
cognitive consequences of particular feature systems.


### Abtract Guidelines

So that we may evaluate all submissions in a fair and equal manner, abstracts which fail to adhere to any of the following guidelines will be
automatically rejected. Abstracts will be evaluated under a two-tiered system involving both external and internal reviewers.

1. Submit your abstract(s) in PDF format with filename PaperTitle.pdf (e.g., Prosodic_Form_and_Discourse_Function.pdf).
2. Include paper title and keywords (i.e., CLS session title, linguistic subfield(s), language(s)/ language family) in the abstract.
3. Limit abstracts to two letter-sized or A4 pages in length, inclusive of data and references. Use one-inch margins and a font size no smaller than 11 points. Incorporate data into the main text of the abstract, not on a separate page.
4. Anonymize submissions by not including author name(s) in the abstract or filename. If necessary, remove author name(s) from the document properties of the PDF file.
5. Use the [Easychair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cls52) platform for the submission of abstracts. 
6. Restrict submissions to one individual and one joint abstract per author, or two joint abstracts per author.
