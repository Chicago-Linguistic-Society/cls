        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. Our linguistics conference has been held almost every year since 1965. This past academic year (2020-2021), CLS hosted the 57th iteration of its conference online from May 6th - May 8th, 2021. For the upcoming academic year (2021-2022), CLS will host the 58th iteration in-persom from April 22-24, 2022.
