    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. Our linguistics conference has been held almost every year since 1965.
        <br/><br/>
        CLS conferences have provided unique opportunities for the University of Chicago linguistics community to coordinate, host, and participate in intense scholarly discussions with researchers from around the world. In addition to hosting the conference itself, CLS publishes the proceedings of the conference, which CLS officers edit
        and compile into a volume.
        <br/><br/>
        For the upcoming academic year 2023-2024, CLS will host the 60th iteration. The date is April 26-28, 2024.
