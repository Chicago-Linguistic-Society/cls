    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
        The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. Our linguistics conference has been held almost every year since 1965.
        <br/><br/>
        CLS conferences have provided unique opportunities for the University of Chicago linguistics community to coordinate, host, and participate in intense scholarly discussions with researchers from around the world. In addition to hosting the conference itself, CLS publishes the proceedings of the conference, which CLS officers edit
        and compile into a volume.
        <br/><br/>
        For the upcoming academic year (2022-2023), CLS will host the 59th iteration in-person from April 28-30, 2023.

<h3>Land Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>
    The Chicago Linguistic Society is headquartered at the University of Chicago, which was built on the occupied and unceded lands ancestrally stewarded by many Native peoples. These include the people of the Council of Three Fires (the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa nations) as well as the Menominee, Kickapoo, Miami, Sac and Fox, and Ho-Chunk nations. Today, Cook County is home to 39,000 Native people representing more than 100 tribal nations.
