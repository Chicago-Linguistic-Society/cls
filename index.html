<div class="introduction">
    <h2>CLS 62</h2>
    <p>
        The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. Our linguistics conference has been held almost every year since 1965.
        <br/><br/>
        CLS conferences provide unique opportunities for the University of Chicago linguistics community to coordinate, host, and participate in intense scholarly discussions with researchers from around the world. In addition to hosting the conference itself, CLS publishes its proceedings, which are edited and compiled into a volume by CLS officers.
        <br/><br/>
        The 62nd Annual Meeting of the Chicago Linguitic Society (CLS 62) will be held from April 17 through April 19, 2026 at the University of Chicago.

        <p>
            The Chicago Linguistic Society is headquartered at the University of Chicago, which was built on the occupied and unceded lands ancestrally stewarded by many Native peoples. These include the people of the Council of Three Fires (the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa nations) as well as the Menominee, Kickapoo, Miami, Sac and Fox, and Ho-Chunk nations. Today, Cook County is home to over 56,000 Native and Indigenous people representing more than 100 tribal nations and Indigenous communities.
