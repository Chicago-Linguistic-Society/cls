        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            The Chicago Linguistic Society is the oldest student-run linguistics organization in the United States. Our linguistics conference has been held almost every year since 1965.
            

            CLS conferences have provided unique opportunities for the University of Chicago linguistics
            community to coordinate, host, and participate in intense scholarly discussions with researchers from around the world.
            In addition to hosting the conference itself, CLS publishes the proceedings of the conference, which CLS officers edit
            and compile into a volume.

            This past academic year (2020-2021), CLS hosted the 57th iteration of its conference online from May 6th - May 8th, 2021. For the upcoming academic year (2021-2022), CLS will host the 58th iteration in-person from April 22-24, 2022.

These include the people of the Council of Three Fires (the Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa nations) as well as the Menominee, Kickapoo, Miami, Sac and Fox, and Ho-Chunk nations. Today, Cook County is home to 39,000 Native people representing more than 100 tribal nations.
